targetAudience: Computer professionals assessing the usability of computer
  products with children
findings: If the testing environment is too playful then children may be
  distracted from performing the test. On the contrary, if it is too adult like
  to child may feel less comfortable during the test.
summary: Make the testing environment more child-friendly
notes: A usability testing lab is is a quiet room set up with computer equipment
  as well as a camera to record interactions, and a one-way mirror to an
  observation room.
bestPractices: Strike a balance between making the lab more child-friendly and
  an adult-oriented lab environment. For example, placing a couple of colorful
  posters on the wall is great, however, adding giant floor pillows caused one
  child to spend their time having a pillow fight.
