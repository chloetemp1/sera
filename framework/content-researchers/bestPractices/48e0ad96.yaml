cohorts:
  - vision impaired
subCohorts:
  - blind
  - low vision
keywords:
  - remote
  - web usability
findings: Both blind and low-vision users benefitted from the criteria and
  showed reduced navigation times to complete tasks.
summary: Measured the impact web usability criteria had on the vision-impaired
  user experience
bestPractices: Remote evaluation allowed users to interact with applications in
  a familiar environment. The bias of ability was avoided by allowing
  participants to practice JAWS commands before testing so they all have similar
  basic skills. Bias of familiarity was avoided by allowing users preliminary
  navigation on both website versions, and reversing the test order for half of
  participants
methodology: Remote user testing with two groups of of 20 visually impaired
  users (mix of blind and low vision), with ages ranging from 25-68. Users
  already had experience with the software and screen reader with most having
  taken targeted courses by the Association for the Blind. Results were obtained
  via a questionnaire form that was sent at least 3 times, and client-side
  automatic logging was also used as a remote evaluation technique.
tools: All users needed screen reader (JAWS) to navigate the website.
  Client-side automatic logging to detect and record user interactions. Tasks
  were indicated by a "Wizard-based method" which gave users step-by-step
  instructions using dialogue.
notesOfCaution: Remote evaluation made it more difficult to set the client-side
  environment required for testing, and some users had difficulty downloading
  and installing the Java plug-in.
