cohorts:
  - vision impaired
  - children
subCohorts:
  - blind
  - primary school
  - high school
keywords:
  - mobility and orientation
findings: From the interviews, the children use landmarks to navigate, and found
  it is important to provide contextual information of surroundings. The most
  efficient path isn't always used by blind people due to other factors such as
  paths that require less cognitive demand, or have more landmarks.
summary: Guidelines for Designing Mobility and Orientation Software for Blind Children
bestPractices: >-
  - When teaching routes, landmarks are essential

  - Kids learn and produce higher commitment when their tasks are game-orientated

  - Audio cues can include non-spoken sounds

  - From the interviews in this study, the children use landmarks to navigate, and found it is important to provide contextual information of surroundings

  - The most efficient path isn't always used by blind people due to other factors such as paths that require less cognitive demand, or have more landmarks
methodology: Open, unstructured interview with recorded audio was used as well
  as written observations. 5 blind people between 20 and 32 years old, 7 blind
  children between 8 and 14 years old, M&O specialists, and special education
  education teachers were also involved. Formative and summative end-user
  usability evaluations are recommended for navigation design. Methods such as
  heuristic evaluations, and cognitive walkthroughs are useful to reveal hidden
  requirements.
terminology: M&O = mobility and orientation
notesOfCaution: Be aware of obstacles that blind people cannot detect with their
  aids such as chandeliers, and beams. Be aware that blind people use temporal
  information for navigation.
