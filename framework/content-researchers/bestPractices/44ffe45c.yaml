targetAudience: Computer professionals assessing the usability of computer
  products with children
findings: Children with no computer experience will force testing time to be
  spent teaching basic computer skills rather than gathering useful data.
summary: Choose children with at least some computer experience
notes: A usability testing lab is is a quiet room set up with computer equipment
  as well as a camera to record interactions, and a one-way mirror to an
  observation room.
bestPractices: It is not ideal to be spending valuable testing time by teaching
  a child how to use a mouse. If possible require that children that have
  experience with mouse-driven software at home before they can participate in
  usability testing.
