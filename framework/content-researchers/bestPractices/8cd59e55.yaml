  - In many cases, scientists are able to develop their own
  software. However, sometimes the complexity of the domain and knowledge of the
  scientists is such that this kind of end-user development is not possible.

  - Most issues that arise when software engineers develop software for scientists, arise due to clashes of expectation between the software engineers and the scientists, and from differing understandings of the scientific domain being developed for.

  - Effective user engagement is even more important when the software being developed is complex and scientific, compared to simpler commercial software.

  - Translating high level requirements to low level requirements is trivial for scientists with full domain knowledge, but much more difficult for software engineers who are not the direct users of the software.

  - Scientists may underestimate development times due to inexperience with the requirement to maintain software over time or for different groups of users.

  - One way to encourage user engagement is to design the software so that it immediately delivers scientific benefit, so as to quickly become embedded into the scientist’s workflow.
