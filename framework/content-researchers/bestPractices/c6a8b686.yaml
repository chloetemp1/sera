summary: Testing a wearable device as a navigation system, which gives tactile feedback
bestPractices: Inner clock orientation exercise is the most popular orientation
  finding training method for BVI people.
methodology: The study was observational involving virtual and real test-fields
  with 4 BVI and 4 blindfolded people. The real test-fields were obstacle-free,
  and triple visual landmarks used for localisation purposes.
tools: A tactile wristband with bluetooth module was used to receive guidance
  messages. In the practice phase, a flight control game joystick (PXN-2113 Pro)
  used for participant to give feedback regarding the perceived direction. A
  drone used as an observer to the in-field participants.
terminology: BVI = blind and vision impaired
notesOfCaution: Be aware of the different skin sensitivities people have.
